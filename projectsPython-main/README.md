Repository with 3 Python Projects

# Project 1:

Task Automation and Data Organization

Challenge:

To help control costs, my manager asks me for a daily report with all the company’s merchandise purchases. My job as an analyst is to send an email at the beginning of the workday with the total amount spent, the number of products purchased, and the average price of the products.

Manager’s Email: For this exercise, I use my own email as the manager’s email.

To solve this, I use PyAutoGUI, a library that automates mouse and keyboard commands.

# Project 2:

In the second class of the Python Intensive Course, I learned how to create a data analysis script. In my daily work, it is common to encounter questions about business performance. A growing concept in the industry is data-driven decision-making, which means making choices based on data rather than assumptions.

With this knowledge, I can transform a complex table full of raw data into a highly detailed analysis that serves as a foundation for managerial decision-making.

# Project 3:

In the third lesson of Python Week, I learned how to create a script for process automation. In my work routine, I often deal with repetitive manual tasks that are prone to human errors.

I developed a script that eliminates these issues without even touching the mouse ☺. This automation integrates with the web using the following concepts:

Importing Excel databases
Importing Webdriver libraries using Selenium
